# Not Released Yet
This will be updated when GMBots is released, but right now, this github is being made for when it is released!

# What is GMBots?

GMBots is a addon for Garry's Mod, which is supposed to give servers temporary players before other players join.

# How do they work?

You can create your own bot addon using the "StartCommand" hook.
Or, you can make a addon for GMBots!

# When is it released?

Parts of it are done already, it's just that I need to improve the pathfinding.
Once I fix the pathfinding, I will release GMBots on the Steam Workshop, and on this github page.

# How do I install this?

There is 2 ways.

## Using Steam Workshop.

1. Go to the workshop page. (See below)
2. Press subscribe.
3. And that's it!

Steam Workshop Page: (update later)

## Installing it manually

1. Go to the drive Garry's Mod is installed on.
2. Go to the steam directory. (See below)
3. Open steamapps.
4. Open common.
5. Open Garry's Mod
6. Open garrysmod
7. Open addons (or create it, if it doesn't exist)
8. Extract the zip into the addons folder.
9. And that should be it!
