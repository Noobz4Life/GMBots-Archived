# Not Released Yet
This will be updated when GMBots is released, but right now, this github is being made for when it is released!

# What is GMBots?

GMBots is a addon for Garry's Mod, which is supposed to give servers temporary players before other players join.

# How do they work?

You can create your own bot addon using the "StartCommand" hook.
Or, you can make a addon for GMBots!

# When is it released?

Parts of it are done already, it's just that I need to improve the pathfinding.
Once I fix the pathfinding, I will release GMBots on the Steam Workshop, and on this github page.
