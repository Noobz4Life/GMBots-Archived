~~# Not Released Yet~~
~~This will be updated when GMBots is released, but right now, this github is being made for when it is released!~~

GMBots is now released in beta.

Wiki: https://github.com/Noobz4Life/GMBots/wiki





# What is GMBots?

GMBots is a addon for Garry's Mod, which is supposed to give servers temporary players before other players join.

# How do they work?

You can create your own bot addon using the "StartCommand" hook.
Or, you can make a addon for GMBots, by doing that you have access to functions and hooks that I added, such as the Pathfinding function.

# When is it released?

~~Parts of it are done already, it's just that I need to improve the pathfinding.
Once I fix the pathfinding, I will release GMBots on the Steam Workshop, and on this github page.~~

GMBots is now released in beta. Please note that the pathfinding is really buggy at the moment.
It is currently only released on this Github page and not the Steam Workshop.

# How do I install this?
